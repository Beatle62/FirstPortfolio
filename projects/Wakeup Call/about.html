                Entering a Wakeup Call Espresso Bar should feel like walking into any small café from Trieste to Milano. 
                The people may not be the same here, but the atmosphere is. When we opened our doors on 6th avenue in 2006 our sole ambition was to offer a conscious espresso bar experience. At Wakeup Call we’re all about Espresso and people. And no matter if it’s your first visit or your thousandth cup, you will always find a spot al banco (at our counter).
            </p>
            <p>
                Everybody at Wakeup Call takes great pride in what we do and serve. Our unique coffee blend is purely made from carefully chosen beans, roasted to perfection in Italy. Our menu offers delicious Italian pastries, French Macaroons as well as refreshing drinks. Everything imported from the best producers in the world. That sounds expensive. No, not really. A visit to Wakeup Call is not a once a week experience. 
                We see our espresso as a luxury you can afford every day. And for that reason we keep moderate prices.
