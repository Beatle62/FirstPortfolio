                        <p>Javascript was originally named Mocha, later it was renamed to LiveScript, and then to Javascript. 
                            The language was then submitted to the ECMA International Organization. By that time, Netscape didn't allow the use of the "Javascript" name,
                            so the standarized language is name ECMAScript.
